# Real Food. Real Life.

At Barley Hill, we believe people consist not only of what we eat, but by how we eat as well. Food is a basic fabric of society. Where it comes from, how it is made, and how it is consumed all dramatically affect our communities. Our mission is to share ownership of food to make it local, natural, sustainable, and pivotal to life.
